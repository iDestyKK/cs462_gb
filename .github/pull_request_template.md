If you reach this step you are preparing yourself to submit a PULL REQUEST against the main
COSC462 homework repository. In most cases you should not be doing this, especially if you
are simply planning to submit your homework. The only reason to move forward from here and
submit your pull request is that you have found an issue with the homework code provided by
the lecturer, and you are proposing a fix. If this is the case, please move forward your
contributions. They are more than welcomed.

If you are not proposing fixes to the homework, then you should stop here. Keep in mind that
the code exposed in PR is visible to all member of the project the PR are proposed against,
so in this context your submission will be visible to all other students.
